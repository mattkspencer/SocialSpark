# Premium Website Design Transformation

Transform my basic website into a world-class, premium experience that rivals Apple's design standards. Focus on creating a sophisticated, polished interface that exudes professionalism and trustworthiness.

## Design Philosophy
Create a **luxury digital experience** with:
- **Ultra-minimalist aesthetic** - embrace generous white space and purposeful restraint
- **Premium typography hierarchy** - use sophisticated font pairings with perfect spacing
- **Subtle, refined animations** - micro-interactions that feel premium and purposeful
- **Glass morphism and depth** - layered elements with subtle shadows and transparency
- **Monochromatic sophistication** - neutral color palette with strategic accent colors

## Visual Standards
### Typography
- Primary: SF Pro Display or Inter (clean, modern sans-serif)
- Establish clear hierarchy: Hero (48-72px), Headings (24-36px), Body (16-18px)
- Line height: 1.4-1.6 for optimal readability
- Letter spacing: Tight for headlines, normal for body text

### Color Palette
- **Primary**: Pure whites (#FFFFFF) and deep grays (#1D1D1F, #86868B)
- **Accent**: Single brand color (blue #007AFF or custom)
- **Backgrounds**: Subtle gradients and soft grays (#F5F5F7, #FAFAFA)
- Ensure WCAG AA contrast ratios (4.5:1 minimum)

### Spacing & Layout
- **Grid system**: 12-column responsive grid with consistent gutters
- **Padding**: 80-120px vertical sections, 24-48px component spacing
- **Container**: Max-width 1200px, centered with side padding
- **Cards**: 12-24px border radius, subtle shadows (0 4px 20px rgba(0,0,0,0.1))
